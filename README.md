# Choad
## a (very old) command-line frontend to CDParanoia, CDDB, and LAME.

Choad was written in 2000 to allow me to rip all my CDs easily.  I ran
NetBSD on the desktop.  CD ripping and encoding was a fairly manual
process, especially if you wanted to do it on the command line.

Not long after I finished Choad and successfully devoured my entire CD
collection with five cheap unix boxes, OS X came out.  With iTunes.

Aside from adding a few patches I received through mid 2001, Choad sat
in mothballs until around 2006.  I wanted to rewrite it to support 
distributed encoding and decoding, as well as multiple encodings (e.g.,
encoding to both FLAC and MP3).

Sourceforge wouldn't let me host a project named 'choad', so instead I
wrote Cretin, the CD Ripper, Encoder, and Tagger with an Inoffensive
Name.  That one is even mildly useful today.

It's here mostly so I can chuckle at code I wrote in a rave warehouse
when I was 21.  Feel free to join in!
